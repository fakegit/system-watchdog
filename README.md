# system-watchdog

System watchdog is a python program that will monitor various resources of multiple systems, and graph/chart the 
content of these resources over time. It maintains a landing page that will give you the machine status, and links to 
additional charts and graphs of each system monitored.

It is ideally deployed when you have a number of machines and you need to understand usage patterns of the system 
resources like cpu, memory, disk, network, or need to know when a system is not responding.
